# Final Project of Native App Studio: Trivia app
This app is part of the final project of the course Native App Studio. 

With this app the user can play trivia against other users of the same app. Once logged in, you can choose your preferred category, difficulty and type of question. Then simply hit `Start!` and get ready to beat your friends! Every correctly answered question earns you one point, which goes to your lifelong running total. Compare your score against that of your friends in the `leaderboard` display.
